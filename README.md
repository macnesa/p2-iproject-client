# **Spotify Insight - client**
> Implemented with Vue.js, Pinia, Tailwind CSS

The app's interface has been designed to closely resemble the layout, typography, and color scheme of the original Spotify app, providing users with a consistent and familiar experience. Additionally, i've added dynamic colors that change based on the album colors of their favorite artists, resulting in a visually stunning and personalized experience.
